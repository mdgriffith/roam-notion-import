# Notion -> Roam import helper

Notion can export a nested folder of markdown files, that are already linked.

Roam can import a flat list of files, but doesn't understand either Notion's folder structure or how the relative links work.

So, this little utility helps reformat Notion's export so that it can be imported seamlessly to Roam.
